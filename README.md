# Multiple Disease Prediction Web Application ðŸ©º

A user-friendly web application built with Streamlit for predicting multiple diseases including Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Kidney Disease using machine learning models.

## Features

- **Diabetes Prediction:** Predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on input parameters such as glucose levels, insulin, BMI, and more.
- **Heart Disease Prediction:** Assesses the risk of heart disease using data such as age, cholesterol levels, chest pain types, etc.
- **Kidney Disease Prediction:** Identifies the presence of kidney disease based on various health indicators like blood pressure, serum creatinine, and others.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Backend:** Python
- **Models:** Machine Learning models for disease prediction
- **Deployment:** Streamlit sharing or any other cloud platform

## How It Works

The application is divided into three sections, each corresponding to a disease:

1. **Diabetes Prediction**
   - Input: User details such as pregnancies, glucose level, BMI, age, etc.
   - Model: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) trained on diabetes data.
   - Output: Predicts whether the person has diabetes or not.

2. **Heart Disease Prediction**
   - Input: Parameters like age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol level, etc.
   - Model: Logistic Regression (LG) model trained on heart disease data.
   - Output: Provides the likelihood of heart disease.

3. **Kidney Disease Prediction**
   - Input: Data including blood pressure, specific gravity, red blood cell count, etc.
   - Model: Gradient Boosting (GB) model for kidney disease detection.
   - Output: Predicts if kidney disease is present.

## Models

1. **Diabetes Model:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for predicting diabetes.
2. **Heart Disease Model:** Logistic Regression (LG) model for heart disease detection.
3. **Kidney Disease Model:** Gradient Boosting (GB) model for identifying kidney disease.

## How to Use

1. **Select a Disease Prediction:** Use the sidebar to choose between Diabetes, Heart Disease, or Kidney Disease prediction.
2. **Enter Details:** Fill in the necessary input fields shown on the screen.
3. **Get Results:** Click the "Test Result" button to see the prediction.

## Future Improvements

- Integration of more diseases for prediction.
- Enhancement of the UI for a better user experience.
- Addition of more advanced machine learning models.
